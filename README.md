## 🏢 Work's Projects
**Description:** I work closely with physicians to develop tools that enhance their work performance. My responsibilities include understanding physicians' dilemmas and challenges and devising innovative solutions. This involves identifying gaps between ideal and actual practices and understanding the underlying causes. I leverage my AI and software development expertise to bridge these gaps effectively.

### Project Title:
 - Lutetia: Improving colorectal cancer screening by training physicians with an 𝐀𝐈-𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦.

## 🎓 Master's Project in Translational Neural Engineering Lab (TNE) at EPFL 
**Description:** This thesis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of vibrotactile feedback generated by non-invasive vibrators. The effectiveness is assessed in a virtual environment that allows subjects to control a virtual hand to interact with different objects.

#### Project Title: Development and Testing of a Virtual Environment for the Study of Kinesthetic Feedback Restoration

#### Tasks:
  - Create a user interface to record matching references of proprioceptive illusions via 𝐂#.
  - Research and improve the design of vibrators for inducing proprioceptive illusions.
  - Design experiments with a 𝐯𝐢𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐧𝐯𝐢𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 (𝐌𝐮𝐉𝐨𝐂𝐨) to simulate grasping movements via 𝐂.
  - Conclude the effect of vibrotactile feedback with a 𝐛𝐢𝐝𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 and virtual

#### Results: 
The results show that the vibrotactile feedback generated by the non-invasive vibrators provides subjects with some information about hand movements. This method of assessment can be extended to study proprioceptive feedback generated by non-invasive vibrators. This study has a promising future, and further research is required to achieve significant effectiveness.

#### Technologies Used:
  - **Algorithm**:  
  - **Programming Languages**: C/C++, C#, Raspberry Pi.  
  - **Libraries & Frameworks**: MuJoCo. 
  - **Development Tools**:  VS Code, Windows, Linux.  
  - **Version Control**: None.

## 💼 Internship's Project in IWE1 at RWTH
**Description:** The internship focuses on the CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) pressure sensors. The research is part of Smart Skin, a scientific project aiming to sense objects and surface texture using a skin-like mechanical device.

### Project Title: Influences on the Pressure Output Signals of CMOS Pressure Sensor by an Encapsulation Material

#### Tasks:
  - Developed and tested 𝐂𝐌𝐎𝐒 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐬 both with and without silicone.
  - Analyzed damping effect on the quality of CMOS pressure sensors.
  - Concluded that silicone enables flexible and dexterous use of the sensors without any impact on
performance.

#### Results:
The results show that the data from the CMOS pressure sensor is affected by covering it with a layer of silicone, but this effect can be eliminated by calculating the gain and offset. Silicone makes the whole structure flexible for dexterous applications and only has a minimal influence on performance. Further applications of CMOS pressure sensors with silicone can include finger cots or glove-shaped devices and be applied to limb prostheses.

#### Technologies Used:
  - **Algorithm**: 
  - **Programming Languages**: LabVIEW.  
  - **Libraries & Frameworks**: None. 
  - **Development Tools**: Windows.  
  - **Version Control**: None.

## 📖 Bachelor's Projects at NTUT and CYCU
**Description:** This project aims to develop a new rehabilitation system for stroke patients who suffer from lower limb movement impairment. The second project aims to investigate the differences in EEG signals between the four limbs to enhance the usability of BCIs.

### 1. Project Title: Electroencephalogram (EEG) Analysis of Lower Limbs Motor Imagery for Stroke Patients

#### Tasks:
  - Analyzed 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 (𝐄𝐄𝐆) data from stroke patients and healthy subjects via 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐥𝐚𝐛
  - Concluded that the activated location of motor imagery among participants regularly changed with age, but varied greatly and irregularly among patients who have had a stroke

#### Results:
The initial phase of the project successfully identified EEG differences in lower limb motor imagery in the spatial, spectral, and temporal domains. A set of EEG features was suggested for application in the design of a rehabilitation system.

### 2. Project Title: Four Limbs Motor Imagery in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)

#### Tasks:
  - Analyzed EEG data based on four-limb motor imagery using 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐥𝐚𝐛.
  - Modified data collection procedures in experiments using 𝐂# and 𝐂++.

#### Results:
Improved accuracy of left and right foot imagery from 63% to 80%. I compared different combinations of motor-imagery EEG signals in healthy subjects to develop a potential control approach via BCI. The findings were presented at the 2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ARIS) in an oral presentation titled "Comparison of Upper- and Lower-Limb Motor Imagery EEG."

#### Technologies Used:
  - **Algorithm**: BP(Band Power), PCA, ICA, SVM.
  - **Programming Languages**: MATLAB, C#, C++, Arduino.  
  - **Libraries & Frameworks**: EEGLAB.
  - **Development Tools**: VS Code, Windows.  
  - **Version Control**: None.
